# CEIS236-SQL-Database
Modern daily life is almost inconceivable without databases. Online transactions, course catalogs, search
engines, etc all use databases. We depend on databases for many aspects of our lives. It is important that these
databases are designed and implemented correctly. With the increase of the Internet of Things and growth of
online transactions, it is easy to see that database design, implementation, and management has many
employment opportunities. This project walks through the process of design, development, and implementation
of a relational database.

Scenario:
Design a database system using ER diagrams and normalization. Create the database in a Relational Database
Management System using SQL and create queries to retrieve data from the database.
