Project Scenario
Global Computer Solutions (GCS) is an information technology consulting company with many offices
throughout the United States. The company’s success is based on its ability to maximize its resources —
that is, its ability to match highly skilled employees with projects according to region. To better manage
its projects, GCS has contacted you to design a database so GCS managers can keep track of their
customers, employees, projects, project schedules, assignments, and invoices. In the first phase of the
development, GCS wants you to create a database that tracks their customers and employees by region.
In addition, the database needs to track the employees’ skills and payrate by skill.
The GCS database must support the first phase of GCS’s operations and information requirements. A
basic description of the main entities follows for this first phase:
 -The employees of GCS must have an employee ID, a last name, a first name, a region, and a date of
hire recorded in the system.
 -Valid regions are as follows: Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, Southeast, and Central.
 -Each employee can have many skills, and many employees have the same skill.
 -Each skill has a skill ID, description, and rate of pay. Valid skills are as follows: Data Entry I, Database
Admin I, Database Admin II, Database Architect, Java I, Java II, Python I, Python II.
 -GCS has many customers. Each customer has a customer ID, name, phone number, and region.
